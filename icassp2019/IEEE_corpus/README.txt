10.2.1 Harvard Psychoacoustic Sentences

Harvard Psychoacoustic Sentences is a closed set of 100 sentences developed to test the word intelligibility in sentence context. The sentences are chosen so that the various segmental phonemes of English are represented in accordance with their frequency of occurrence. The test is easy to perform, no training of the subjects is needed and the scoring is simple. However, when using fixed set of sentences, the learning effect is very problematic (Pisoni et al. 1980, Kleijn et al. 1998). The first five sentences of the test material are (Allen et al. 1987):

    * The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks
    * Glue the sheet to the dark blue background
    * It's easy to tell the depth of a well
    * These days a chicken leg is a rare dish
    * Rice is often served in round bowls

Nevertheless the number of sentences is large, the subject may also be familiar with the test material without listening to it. For example, the first one of these sentences is used in many demonstrations or sound examples.
